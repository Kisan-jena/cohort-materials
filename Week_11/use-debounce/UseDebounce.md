# Custom Hooks in React: useDebounce

## What is a Custom Hook?

Custom hooks are JavaScript functions in React that allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components. They follow the naming convention of starting with `use`, indicating that they may rely on React hooks internally.

By creating custom hooks, we reduce code duplication and enhance readability and maintainability.

## What is Debouncing?

Debouncing is a programming pattern that ensures a function does not get called too frequently. It limits the rate at which a function gets invoked, typically for optimizing performance with search inputs, window resizing, or scroll events.

For example, when users type in a search box, debouncing ensures that API requests are not made on every keystroke, but only after the user has stopped typing for a specified amount of time.

## Why use a Debounce Hook?

React apps often need debouncing for:
- Input field value changes (e.g., search queries)
- Resizing or scrolling events
- Preventing unnecessary API requests

Instead of implementing debounce logic in every component, a custom hook makes the logic reusable and clean.

## Creating a `useDebounce` Hook

Hereâ€™s how you can create a `useDebounce` hook from scratch!

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useDebounce(value, delay) {
  // State to store the debounced value
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Set a timer to update debounced value after specified delay
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    // Cleanup function: clear the timeout if value or delay changes
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay]);

  return debouncedValue;
}

export default useDebounce;
```

---

## Explanation of the Code

1. **State Initialization:**
   - `debouncedValue` state is initialized with the passed `value`.

2. **Effect Hook:**
   - Runs every time `value` or `delay` changes.
   - Creates a timeout that sets the `debouncedValue` to `value` after `delay` milliseconds.

3. **Cleanup Function:**
   - Clears the timeout when the component unmounts or `value`/`delay` changes.
   - Prevents memory leaks and ensures the debounce logic is efficient.

4. **Return Value:**
   - Returns the `debouncedValue`, which only updates after the specified delay.

## How to Use the `useDebounce` Hook

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use this custom hook in a React component:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import useDebounce from './useDebounce';

function SearchInput() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const debouncedQuery = useDebounce(query, 500);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedQuery) {
      console.log('Fetching search results for:', debouncedQuery);
      // Call your API here with debouncedQuery
    }
  }, [debouncedQuery]);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={query}
        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default SearchInput;
```

---

## Explanation of Usage

1. **State Management:**
   - `query` holds the value of the input field.
   - `debouncedQuery` receives the debounced version of `query`.

2. **Effect Hook:**
   - Listens for changes to `debouncedQuery`.
   - Triggers the API call or any heavy computation only after the input has stopped changing for 500ms.

3. **Input Field:**
   - Updates `query` on every change, but the effect only fires when the debounce delay has passed.

## Benefits of `useDebounce`

âœ… **Performance Optimization:** Reduces unnecessary function calls.
âœ… **Cleaner Code:** Reusable logic avoids repetition.
âœ… **Readability:** Easier to understand and maintain.
âœ… **Seamless Integration:** Works with any React component.

## Customizing the Hook

You can extend the `useDebounce` hook with more features, like canceling the debounce or invoking an immediate call.

Example: Adding an immediate invocation option:

```jsx
function useDebounce(value, delay, immediate = false) {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (immediate) {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
      return;
    }

    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay, immediate]);

  return debouncedValue;
}
```

---

## Best Practices

- Use a suitable debounce delay for your use case (e.g., 300â€“500ms for search inputs).
- Always clean up side effects with React hooks to avoid memory leaks.
- Test your custom hook thoroughly with different input values and delays.

---

## Conclusion

The `useDebounce` hook is a powerful addition to any React project, providing performance optimizations and a cleaner, more reusable codebase. With this hook, you can seamlessly manage delayed value changes for inputs, API calls, and other UI interactions.

By understanding the principles behind debouncing and React hooks, you can build interactive and efficient applications!
